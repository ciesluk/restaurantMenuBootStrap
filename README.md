In this assignment the goal was to use Bootstrap. We were to make a navigation bar as well as a collapsible menu when the screen size was small enough for a mobile device. A section was also to be created using the "container" class. Additionally, we had to style the page with out own CSS which could be found in style.css file. Please note that we used Bootstrap 3 and note Bootstrap 5 for this assignment.
